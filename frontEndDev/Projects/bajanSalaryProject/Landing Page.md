### Essential
These are the tasks and features that are required for the main functionality of project to be achieved.

#### Wireframe
I have decided to use the template provided by [Landing Page Wireframe Template | Moqups](https://moqups.com/templates/wireframes-mockups/landing-page-wireframe/) as the frontpage that I will attempt to replicate.

**Navbar**
I used a Bulma basic header to do this. During this process I learned about converting array-like objects (e.g. Nodelists) to arrays through the use of of the `Array.prototype.slice.call()`method. Additional information can be found here:  http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/arrayprototypeslice.shtml
