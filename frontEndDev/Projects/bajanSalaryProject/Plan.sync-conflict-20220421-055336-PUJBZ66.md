# Bajan Salary and Jobs Project

## Description (High Level)
This project aims to create a website which will capture and display information related to jobs in Barbados. Specifically users will be able to anonymously enter in job specific data such as:
- Salary
- Benefits
- Industry
- Education Level
- Length of time in position
- Previous job held
- Job Title
	- General Staff
	- Manager
	- Supervisor
- Job Satisfaction

Users will then be able to get information on job specific data such as:

- Industry specific salaries
- Average Salaries
- Typical Requirements for Job
- Job Satisfaction

The hope is that this information can be used by Barbadians to make more informed decisions about what career to purse and be better able to know if they are being underpaid.
