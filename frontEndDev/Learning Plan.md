# Why Become A Developer?

I want to become a developer because:

1. More job opportunities
2. Higher pay
3. Ability to work in places other than Barbados
4. Ability to work remotely
5. Better job flexibility
6. Ability to express my creativity and build things that are personally interesting and important to me
7. Can define my niche area when it comes to things that I care passionately about:
	- Leftist Politics and movements to change the system that we currently live in.
	- Agriculture. composting and vermicomposting. 

My main goal is to become a **Front-end Developer** w/ some knowledge of the backend. **I am choosing this path because the work of a full-stack developer is increasingly accessible to someone with primarily front-end knowledge.** This is made possible by services such as Vercel and AWS Amplify coupled with React, Vue frameworks and serverless API servers + static sites.

Using the WOOP (Wish, Outcome, Obstacles and Plans) method, the following is what I want to achieve:

1.  **Wish**: My main goal is to become a **Front-end Developer** w/ some knowledge of the backend. **I am choosing this path because the work of a full-stack developer is increasingly accessible to someone with primarily front-end knowledge.** This is made possible by services such as Vercel and AWS Amplifiy coupled with React, Vue frameworks and serverless API servers + static sites.
2.  **Outcome**: My ultimate goal is to develop web apps that will bring in additional income and will allow me to to gain financial independence. 
3.  **Obstacles:**
-  Acquiring necessary knowledge to make production ready apps.
- Having the discipline and motivation needed to achieve my goals

4.  **Plan**: 
	- Research skills that are in demand for jobs.
	- Learn key programming theory:
		- Syntax
		- Thinking like a programmer
		- How to find answers to problems and how to ask the right questions.
		- How to learn to code
	- Get Practical experience:
	- Have a strong portfolio:
		- Build web apps/websites to learn concepts out of personal interests
		- Build websites for friends for free
	- Code buddy/code group practice
	- Hackathons
	- Apply for jobs in Barbados and abroad

## How To Learn

This is based on: [How To Learn Stuff Quickly (joshwcomeau.com)](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/how-to-learn-stuff-quickly/)

I need to split time between [[#Guided Learning]] and [[#Unguided Learning]] learning.  A good cadence to work with is spend time learning the basics through guided learning then switching to unguided and switching back and forth between the two. 

Guided learning will be my initial start but in order to reinforce concepts I plan to try to:

1. Repeat learning material without looking at the resource.
2. Play around with, and experiment with tasks given in guided work. For example, if given a twitter app to work with, make a FB clone app. Purposely modify projects to gain a greater understanding of how the code works.

As I progress I plan to incorporate more [[#Unguided Learning]]  learning: Projects!

### Stages of Learning How to Code
Based on: [Why Learning to Code is So Damn Hard | Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/blog/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard/)

**There are four phases to survive:**

1.  Hand-holding honeymoon phase
2.  Cliff of confusion
3.  Desert of Despair
4.  Upswing of Awesome

![[Pasted image 20211208112942.png]]

#### 1. Surviving the Hand-holding Honeymoon Phase
**Good Points**
-   Lots of resources to get me started
-   Least challenging phase

**Goals**

-   Try out different resources to find out what I prefer(open-minded): 
-   Pick one resource and stick with it and finish introductory stuff.

#### 2. Surviving the Cliff of Confusion

This phase occurs when you begin to make projects on your own. It can be frustrating at times due to constant debugging, not knowing where to search for answers or not even knowing the right questions to ask. This phase is characterized by a rapidly increasing  scope of knowledge required to implement  even seemingly small changes.

  **Survival Tips**

-   **Work with someone else**: two pairs of eyes are better than one for analysing errors.
-   **Read other people’s code:** this increases familiarity with good code patterns and concepts. This also increases technical sophistication(See Learn Enough Command Line to be Dangerous). 
-   **Start Small and Build Constantly**: build projects that interest me. Start small so as to gain confidence and to develop skills such as being able to debug and search for answers to questions. 

**Action Plan** 

-   Need to find someone to collaborate with.
-   Continue to periodically check posts on Dev.to, the freeCodeCamp forum, glitch.com, 30secondsofcode, codeply and smashingmagazine
- Use Trello Board to Set Learning Objectives and pursue them daily. 

### How to Learn Complex Things Quickly: A Guide

Based on this: [How to Learn Complex Things Quickly: A Guide (hubspot.com)](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/how-to-learn-complex-things-quickly)


#### Define your goals

-   **Break whatever you’re trying to learn down into use cases.** Start with bite sized chunks that take a few minutes and build on them incrementally. “Learning python” is too broad. Installing python, printing hello world, installing and using a dependency, reading from a file, etc. are more well-defined, and it’s easier to know when you’re done, therefore helping to reinforce progress.  
      
    
-   **Consider how much you need to learn to accomplish each.** Bucketing things into "need to know more" and "skip the details for now" can be helpful. For instance, I don't know how python dependency management works, but I can rely on it working and make progress without that knowledge.  
      
    
-   **Start by just trying stuff**. You might be scared that you’ll screw something up, but in my experience computers are pretty hard to break. Use the mental models that you already have to guess at how it might work. If it doesn’t, then you can respond to error messages.  
      
    
-   **Take breaks**. If you’re in the groove and cruising, by all means ⁠— keep in the flow. But if you’re finding that you’re losing steam, moving sideways, or retreading old ground, give your brain a rest. If you defined your goals in small increments, you should be able to walk away feeling like you made some progress and give your brain time to process what you’ve learned.

#### Reflect on the process

-   Summarize and share what you’ve learned - that’s a good habit for all knowledge workers
-   Where did you spend time that didn’t help you get closer to your goal?
-   What would have made it easier for you to learn again?

-   Docs clarifications? Interface changes?
-   Can you fix them (internal or open source) or suggest changes to make it easier for future learners?

## Guided Learning

Reading a tutorial, taking a course, watching a YouTube video. Anything where you're following a guide.

# Motivation / Goals

Based on this: [Staying focused, the productive way (codewithoutrules.com)](https://codewithoutrules.com/2018/05/20/staying-focused/)

Also see [[# Define your goals | here]]

Knowing my goal is key to being and remaining productive; understanding why I do what I do will enable me to remain focussed at the task at hand even if the specific task is nothing that I care about. 

Once you know goals, you can actually know what it takes to be productive, because you’ll know what you’re working towards. Once you know your goals, you can start thinking about how to avoid distractions because you’ll know you’re doing work that’s worth doing.

Before you start a task, ask yourself: what are my goals? And don’t start coding until you have an answer.
